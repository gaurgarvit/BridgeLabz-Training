Programming Elements – Assignment

17-12-2025

This folder contains a set of Java programs completed as part of the Programming Elements assignment. The tasks involve implementing basic arithmetic operations, handling user input, performing unit conversions, and applying simple mathematical formulas. Through this work, I gained a stronger understanding of core Java syntax, improved my ability to structure small programs effectively, and developed a more disciplined approach to writing clean and readable code.
I have also solved 10 more questions in the leetcode-codebase to practice these concepts more.

Today I did set of Java programs from level 1 and level 2 of programming elements. The exercises cover a wide range of beginner programming tasks, including arithmetic operations, input handling, unit conversions, logical computations, and simple problem-solving scenarios. These programs collectively demonstrate an understanding of core Java syntax and foundational programming techniques.

Through this assignment, I strengthened my ability to write modular and readable code, improved my problem-solving approach across various small-scale tasks, and built confidence in implementing real-world logic using basic Java constructs.
